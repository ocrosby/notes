# GitOps

GitOps is a way to do Kubernetes cluster management and application delivery. It works by using Git as a single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications. With Git at the center of your delivery pipelines, developers can make pull requests to accelerate and simplify application deployments and operations tasks to Kubernetes.

## Principles

- **Declarative**: The entire system is described declaratively, using versioned configuration files.
- **Version controlled**: All changes are made through pull requests and Git commits.
- **Automated**: The system is self-healing and self-improving.
- **Consistent**: The system is always in the desired state.
- **Secure**: The system is secure by default.
- **Collaborative**: The system encourages collaboration.
- **Observable**: The system is observable.
- **Scalable**: The system is scalable.
- **Extensible**: The system is extensible.
- **Simple**: The system is simple.
