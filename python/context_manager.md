# Context Managers in Python

## Overview

Context managers allow you to allocate and release resources precisely when you want to. The most widely used
example of context managers is the `with` statement. Suppose you have two related operations which youâ€™d like
to execute as a pair, with a block of code in between. Context managers allow you to do specifically that.
