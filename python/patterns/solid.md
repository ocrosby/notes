# SOLID

## Single Responsibility Principle

A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.

## Open/Closed Principle

Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

## Liskov Substitution Principle

Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.

## Interface Segregation Principle

A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use or clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

## Dependency Inversion Principle

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
