# Using Jupyter Notebook

Install pipx using Homebrew:

```shell
brew install pipx
```

Install Jupyter Notebook using pipx:

```shell
pipx install jupyterlab
```

Change into your target directory:

```shell
cd ~/path/to/your/notebooks
```

Start Jupyter Notebook:

```shell
jupyter-lab
```

This will open a new tab in your default browser with the Jupyter Notebook interface.

You can create a new notebook by clicking on the "New" button in the upper right corner and selecting "Python 3" from the dropdown menu.

Each notebook will be saved as a separate .ipynb file within that directory.
