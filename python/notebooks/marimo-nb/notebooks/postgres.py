        # Schemas

        A client connection to the server can only access data in a single database, the one specified in the connection request.

        A database contains one or more named `schemas`, which in turn contain tables. Schemas also contain other kinds of named objects including:

        - data types
        - functions
        - operators

        Within one schema, two objects of the same type cannot have the same name. Furthermore, tables, squences, indcexes, views, materialized views, and foreign tables share the same namespace, so that, for example an index and a table must have different names if they are in the same schema. The same object can be used in different schemas without conflict; for example, both sschema1 and myschema can contain tables named mytable. Unlike databases, schemas are not rigidly separated: a user can access objects in any of the schemas in the database they are connected to, if they have privileges to do so,

        There are several reasons why one my want to use schemasðŸ¥‡

        - To allow many users to use one database without interfering with each other.
        - To organize database objects into logical groups to make them more manageable.
        - Third-party applications can ber put into separate schemas so they do not collide with the names of other objects.

        Schemas are analogous to directories at the operating system level, except that schemas cannot be nested.

        ## Creating a Schema

        ```sql
        CREATE SCHEMA myschema;
        ```

        To create or access object in a schema, write a qualified name consisting opf the schema name separated by a dot:

        ```sql
        schema.table
        ```

        To create a table in the new schema:

        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE myschema.mytable (
            ...
        );
        ```

        To drop a schema if it's empty (all objects in it have to be dropped), use:

        ```sql
        DROP SCHEMA myschema;
        ```

        To drop a schema including all contained objects, use:

        ```sql
        DROP SCHEMA myschema CASCADE;
        ```

        If you want to create a schema owned by someone else:

        ```sql
        CREATE SCHEMA schema_name AUTHORIZED user_name;
        ```

        To show the current search path:

        ```sql
        SHOW search_path;
        ```

        ---

        Default Output:

        ```plaintext
         search_path
        --------------
         "$user", public
        ```

        The first element specifies that a schema with the same name as the current user is to be searched. If no such schema exists, the entry is ignored. The second element refers to the public schema.

        The first schema in the search path that exists is the default location for creating new objects.

        To put our new schema in the path, we use:

        ```sql
        SET search_path TO myschema,public;
        ```

        Since myschema is fht efirst element in the path, new objects would by default be created in it.

        We could have also written:

        ```sql
        SET search_path TO myschema;
        ```

        Then we no longer have access to the public schema without explicit qualification.  There is nothing special about the public schema excep that it exists by default. It can be dropped, too.

        By default, users cannot access any objects in schemas they do not own. To allow that, the owner of the schema must grant the USAGE privilege on the schema.

        A user can also be allowed to create objects in someone else's schema. To allow that, the `CREATE` privilege on the schema needs to be granted. In databases upgraded from PostgreSQL 14 or earlier, everyone has that privilege on schema `public`. Some usage patterns call for revoking that privilege:

        # The System Catelog Schema

        In addition to `public` and user-created schemas, each database contains a `pg_catelog` schema, which contains the system tables and all the built-in data types, functions, operators. `pg_catelog` is always effectively part of the search path. If it is not named explicitly in th epath then it is implicitly searched before search path's schemas. This ensures that built-in names will always be findable. However, you can explicitly palce `pg_catalog` at the end of your search path if you prefer to have user-defined names override built-in names.

        Since system table names begin with pg_, it is best to avoid such names to ensure that you won't suffer a conflict if some future version defines a system table anmed the same as your table.

This pattern is a secure schema usage pattern unless an untrusted user is the database owner or has been granted ADMIN OPTION on a relevant role, in which case no secure schema usage pattern exists.

    In PostgreSQL 15 and later, the default configuration supports this usage pattern. In prior versions, or when using a database that has been upgraded from a prior version, you will need to remove the public CREATE privilege from the public schema (issue REVOKE CREATE ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC).
