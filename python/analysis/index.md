# Data Analysis in Python

## Overview

In Python there are three main libraries used for data analysis:

- [Pandas](./pandas/index.md)
- [Numpy](./numpy/index.md)
- [Matplotlib](./matplotlib/index.md)

**Pandas** is a data manipulation library that provides data structures and functions to manipulate data. Numpy is a library that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. Matplotlib is a plotting library that provides a MATLAB-like interface for creating plots.

**NumPy** is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

**Matplotlib** is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK.

Having a working knowledge of these three libraries is essential for data analysis in Python.
