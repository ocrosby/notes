### Go Language Basics and Syntax

- Review the basic syntax and features of Go, such as types, variables, and control structures.
- Understand how to effectively structure Go code using packages.

### Concurrency in Go

- Explore Goâ€™s concurrency model, focusing on goroutines, channels, and the `sync` package.
- Learn common concurrency patterns used in Go applications.

### Profiling and Optimization

- Use Go's built-in profiling tools to analyze CPU and memory usage.
- Learn to optimize Go applications based on profiler outputs.

### Dependency Management

- Get familiar with Go's modules for managing dependencies, introduced in Go 1.11.

### Go Packages and Frameworks

- Gain practical experience with important Go packages and frameworks:
    - **Gorilla-Mux** or **Chi**: HTTP routing
    - **Gorm**: Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)
    - **Go Kit**: Building microservices
    - **gRPC**: Inter-service communication

Package gorilla/mux implements a request router and dispatcher for matching incoming requests to their 
respective handler.

The name mux stands for "HTTP request multiplexer". Like the standard http.ServeMux, mux.Router matches
incoming requests against a list of registered routes and calls a handler for the route that matches the URL
or other conditions.  The main features are:

- It implements the http.Handler interface, so it is compatible with the standard http.ServeMux.
- Requests can be matched based on URL host, path, path prefix, schemes, header and query values, HTTP methods or using custom matchers.
- Url hosts, paths and query values can have variables with an optional regular expression.
- Registered URLs can be built, or "reversed", which helps maintaining references to resources.
- Routes can be used as subrouters; nested routes are only tested if 

### RESTful API Design

- Understand the fundamentals of RESTful API design and implementation in Go.
- Handle JSON, middleware, and error management in HTTP servers.

### Database Integration

- Focus on PostgreSQL: Use libraries like `pq` or `pgx` for database integration.
- Review database schema design, queries, transactions, and connection pooling.

### Unit and Integration Testing

- Write comprehensive unit and integration tests using Go's `testing` package and `testify`.
- Understand best practices in testing Go applications.

### Application Architecture and System Design

- Review software architecture fundamentals, particularly microservices architecture and scalable designs.
- Consider common architectural patterns in large-scale Go applications.

### Industry-Specific Knowledge

- If relevant, study the basics of financial systems and software design in the financial industry.

## Conclusion

Each topic is crucial for understanding both the theoretical and practical aspects of software development using Go. Engage in practical exercises, such as building small projects or contributing to open-source projects, to enhance your learning experience.
