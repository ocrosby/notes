<p>In this section there are six guided exercises for you to work through, all of which extend the Snippetbox application that we&rsquo;ve created to include some additional functionality.</p>

<p>The exercises leverage the code patterns and techniques that we&rsquo;ve already covered in this book, but they are applied in a slightly different context. So going through them is a good opportunity to test your understanding of what you&rsquo;ve learned, and practice putting it into use.</p>

<p>Each exercise is broken up into a few small-ish steps. And for each step I&rsquo;ve linked to an answer containing some &lsquo;suggested code&rsquo; which you may wish to look at if you get stuck. You may also find it interesting to compare and contrast the suggested code against yours &mdash; either at the end of the exercise or as you go along. If your code looks slightly different, no worries. There&rsquo;s more than one way to achieve the same goal.</p>

<p>A final note before we get started: A couple of the exercises in this section build on each other, so I recommend working through them in order.</p>
