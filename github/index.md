# GitHub

This document contains my personal notes on GitHub.

## Overview

GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git.  It is mostly used for computer code.  It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.  It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.


Adding a local repo to GitHub with the GitHub CLI

> gh repo create project-name

If you want your project to belong to an organization instead of your user account specify the organization name and project name 

> gh repo create jedi-knights/project-name
