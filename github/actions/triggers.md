# Triggers

You can configure your workflows to run when:

- specific activity on GitHub happens
- at a scheduled time
- when an event outside of GitHub occurs

Workflow Trigger
: events that cause a workflow to run

Some events have multiple activity types.  For these events, you can specify which activity types will trigger a 
workflow run.
