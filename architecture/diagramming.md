# Diagramming

In order to choose tools that will be useful for diagramming I was very 
interested in tools that would allow me to create diagrams that could be
consumed by GitHub.

## Tools

### Structurizr

Structurizr builds upon “diagrams as code”, allowing you to create multiple diagrams from a single model using a number of tools and programming languages.

Free and open source with a paid web platform.

Best for technical people who want to use the C4 model with a DSL and check it into source control.

It includes features such as:

#### Features

* Apache License 2.0
* Diagrams as code to draw diagrams using the Structurizr DSL.
* Stored in source control to be where the engineering team is.
* Designed to support C4 Model.
* Architectural Decision Records in a documentation tool.

### Mermaid.js

simple text based syntax.  It is very easy to use and the diagrams can be
rendered in a variety of formats.
