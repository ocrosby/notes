# C4 models as code

## What is the C4 Model?

The C4 Model is a simple hierarchical way to think about the static structures of a software system in terms of containers, components, and code. It was developed by Simon Brown, and is described in detail in his book [Software Architecture for Developers](https://leanpub.com/software-architecture-for-developers).

C4 is esentially 2 things

a higherarchical system of two things

- higherarchical set of abstractions
    - a software system
    - a software system is made up of one or more "containers" (not docker containers)
    - a container is made up of one or more "components"
    - a component is made up of one or more "code elements"
    - a code element is made up of one or more "classes"
    - a class is made up of one or more "methods"
    - a method is made up of one or more "lines of code"
    - a line of code is made up of one or more "characters"
    - a character is made up of one or more "bits"


- a higherarchical set of diagrams
    - a system context diagram
    - a context diagram
    - a container diagram
    - a component diagram
    - a code diagram

The C4 model is notation independent.
There are essentially modeling tools and diagramming tools.

## System Context Diagram

A system context diagram is a diagram that shows the system in scope and the other systems that it interacts with. It is a high level diagram that shows the system as a box and the other systems as boxes with lines connecting them.

### Questions Answered by System Context Diagrams

In order to draw a system context diagrams these are the questions you need to ask.

- What is the scope of the software system we are building?
- Who is using it?
- What are they doing?
- What system integrations does it need to support?

## Container Diagram

### Questions Answered by Container Diagrams

In order to draw a container diagram these are the questions you need to ask.

- What are the major technology building blocks?
- What are their responsibilities?
- How do they communicate?

Here we include the applications and data stores of the thing we are implementing.
