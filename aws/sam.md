AWS SAM has two parts

### Transform templates

Shorthand syntax exppresses resources and event source mappings;
it provides infrastructure as code (IaC) for serverless applications.

### AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)

Provides tooling for local development with rapid iteration, debugging,
build, packaging, and deployment for serverless applications.
