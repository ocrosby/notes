# Reactive Extensions for JavaScript (RxJS)

It is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences.  It provides one core type: the **Observable** and three satellite types: **Observer**, **Scheduler**, and **Subject**.  RxJS also provides over 100 operators inspired by Array extras -- for example map, filter, reduce, every, and more -- to allow handling asynchronous events and collections.
