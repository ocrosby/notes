When wrangling with a question we take the following steps:

1. We find data to help us answer our question. 
2. We wrangle the data into a format to help us answer our question. 
3. We explore the data by plotting and calculating summary statistics. 
4. We fit a model to help us quantify and confirm our observations. 
5. Lastly, and most importantly, we share our results (optionally, but possibly most importantly, we settle the wagers to the “questions” we answered with data).
