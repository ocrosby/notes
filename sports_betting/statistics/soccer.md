# Soccer Statistics

## Shots

1. A shot is an attempt that is taken with the intent of scoring and is directed toward the goal.
2. A cross or crossing pass is not a shot. A cross is a long kick from a wide position into the penalty
   area in front of the goal. The intent of a cross is to set up a scoring opportunity for an attacking player.
   A goalkeeper who intercepts a cross is not credited with a save. Exception: A cross that the
   goalkeeper stops that otherwise would have entered the goal is considered a shot, and the
   goalkeeper is credited with a save.

   Example: Player A dribbles the ball the length of the field in the direction of the opponentʼs
   net. He dribbles the ball toward the corner before lofting a pass in front of the net to his/her
   teammate. However, while the ball is still in the air, Player B, Team B's goalkeeper, grabs it to
   prevent the shot on goal. RULING: Even though the keeper grabbed the ball, it is not
   considered a save because the intent of the offensive player was to pass to another player and
   not to shoot. Player A is not credited with a shot, and the goalkeeper on Team B is not credited
   with a save.
3. A shot on goal is a shot that is on net. The results of a shot on goal must be either a save by the
   goalkeeper or defending team or a goal by the attacking team. A shot that hits the post or crossbar
   without being deflected by a goalkeeper or defender and does not cross the goal line is not a shot on
   goal.

## Goals

1. An offensive player who either kicks or heads the ball into the goal is awarded a goal. Each goal
   shall count two points in the playerʼs statistical record.
   (1) When a defender kicks or heads the ball into the defenderʼs goal with the intent of making a
   pass to a teammate or of clearing the ball, a goal is not awarded to an individual but is recorded
   as an "own goal." An "own goal" counts towards the offensive (not defensive) team's season
   total.
   Example: Player B1 is being pressured by Player A1 in the defensive half of the field. He tries
   to pass the ball back to Player B2, team B's goalkeeper, but the pass is wide of B2 and before
   he can catch up with it, the ball goes into the net. RULING: Credit Team A with an "own goal,"
   which goes towards its team total and also counts against Player B2ʼs goals-against average.
   Although an "own goal" is scored by the defensive team, the goal still counts against the team's
   goalkeeper as a goal allowed.
   An offensive player whose shot is deflected into the goal by the goalkeeper or a defender receives
   credit for the goal, provided the momentum of the shot carried the ball into the goal.
   An offensive player whose pass is deflected into the goal by a defender or whose pass is mishandled
   by the goalkeeper and allowed to cross into the goal shall receive credit for a shot and a goal,
   provided the defender never gained full control of the ball. This applies equally to corner kicks and
   throw-ins.

Example: Player A1 fires a shot from 20 yards that appears to be going wide of the net. It hits
Player B1 five yards in front of the net, redirecting it past Player B2, Team B's keeper, and into
the net. RULING: Although Player A1ʼs shot was initially going wide, the momentum of his shot
is what carried it into the net, so he is credited with the goal.
Example: Player A1 attempts a throw-in from the sideline. Team Bʼs goalkeeper, Player B1,
mishandles the ball while attempting to make the stop, and the ball rolls in to Team Bʼs goal
without being touched by another player. RULING: Credit Player A1 with the goal since no
other Team A player touched the ball, the momentum of the throw carried the ball into the net
and Player B1 never gained full control of the ball.
If an attacking player shoots and the ball is deflected unintentionally by a teammate, and goes into
the net, credit the initial attacking player with the goal.
Example: Player A1 shoots and the ball strikes teammate A2 in the back, and goes
untouched into the goal. Credit A1 with the goal, provided that teammate A2 clearly was not attempting to make a play on the ball.


## Assists

1. An assist is awarded for a pass leading directly to a goal. Not more than two assists may be
   credited on any one play. Each assist shall count one point in the playerʼs statistical record.
   (1) If a scoring play consists of two consecutive passes without a defender gaining control of
   the ball , two assists may be awarded, provided the second player does not have to elude a
   defender to make the final pass. Both passes must have a direct influence on the outcome of
   goal scored. If the second player needs to elude a defender before passing to the goal-scorer,
   credit only that assist.
   Example: Player A1 passes the ball to Player A2, who dribbles past Player B1. Player A2ʼs
   forward movement is being contested by Player B1 before Player A2 passes the ball to Player
   A3, who heads the ball into the net. RULING: Only Player A2 is awarded an assist. Since
   Player A2 had to free himself from the defender to get the ball to Player A3, only one assist is
   given even though the defender never touched the ball.
   Example: Player A1 sends a corner kick into the goal area that is headed by Player A2
   straight to Player A3, who scores. RULING: Credit assists to Player A1 and Player A2. Both
   touches, by Player A1 and Player A2, led directly to the goal.
   (2) No assist is awarded when a player gains control from the defensive team and scores.
   (3) No assist is awarded on a penalty-kick goal.
   Example. Player A1 receives a pass from Player A2 and then is tripped in the penalty box,
   and Team A is awarded a penalty kick. Player A1 converts the penalty kick. RULING: Credit
   Player A1 with a goal, but do not credit Player A2 with an assist. No assist can be given on a
   penalty kick.
   (4) No assist is awarded on an “own goal.”
   (5) A corner kick, throw-in or free kick leading to a goal each counts as a pass in awarding
   assists.
   (6) A player cannot receive credit for an assist on a goal that the player also scores.
   (7) A player is not credited with an assist if that playerʼs possession is terminated by an
   opposing defenderʼs tackle.
   Example: Player A1 dribbles down the middle. Player B1 slide tackle knocks the ball toward
   Player A2, who then scores. RULING: No assist is given. It was not Player A1ʼs intent to pass
   the ball, nor to score. Rather, the ball was simply knocked away by the defender.
   (8) If an attacking playerʼs shot hits a post or crossbar and bounces back into the field of play
   and, before a defender can touch the ball, another attacker shoots the ball into the goal, credit
   the player whose shot hit the post or crossbar with an assist.
   (9) If an attacking player shoots and the goalkeeper or defender blocks the shot but cannot
   control the ball, and a second attacking player immediately knocks the rebound in for a goal,
   credit the player who took the first shot with an assist.
   Example: Player A1 passes the ball to Player A2, who dribbles into the corner and crosses
   the ball to Player A3, who heads the ball toward the net. The ball bounces off Player B1, team
   Bʼs keeper, to Player A1, who puts it into the net. RULING: Credit only Player A3 with the
   assist. Once a shot deflects off the keeper (or defender), the pass by Player A2 to Player A3
   no longer has a direct impact on the goal being scored.
   (10) If an attacking player shoots and the goalkeeper or defender blocks the shot but cannot
   control the ball, and the same attacking player immediately knocks the rebound in for a goal,
   no assist is credited.

Example: Player A1 crosses the ball to Player A2, who heads the ball toward the net. The ball
bounces off Player B1, team Bʼs keeper, back to Player A1, who puts it into the net. RULING:
No assist is credited. As in the previous example, once a shot deflects off the keeper (or
defender), the pass by Player A1 to Player A2 no longer has a direct impact on the goal being
scored. 

## Goalkeeping

1. A save is awarded to a goalkeeper only if a shot otherwise would have gone into the goal. A
   goalkeeper can be credited with a save without catching the ball. If the goalkeeper blocks the ball or
   punches it wide or over the goal, that goalkeeper can be credited with a save, provided the ball would
   have otherwise gone into the goal. To receive a save, the play must be a shot on goal. A goalkeeper
   cannot receive credit for a save on a cross. Exception: A cross that the goalkeeper stops that
   otherwise would have entered the goal is considered a shot, and the goalkeeper is credited with a
   save.
2. A goalkeeper receives credit for a shutout only by playing the entire contest. If two or more
   goalkeepers participate in a game in which no goals are allowed, credit the team with a shutout but do
   not award any goalkeeper an individual or shared shutout. A goalkeeper must be solely responsible
   for holding the opposition scoreless to be credited with a shutout.
3. If a contest ends in a scoreless tie, credit both teams with a shutout.
4. A goalkeeperʼs goals-against average is calculated by multiplying the number of goals allowed by
   80, divided by the actual number of minutes played by the keeper. A team's goals-against average is
   figured by multiplying the number of goals allowed by the team by 80, divided by the actual number of
   minutes played. 

GAA=(Goals allowed x 80) ÷ minutes played
5. If a player other than the teamʼs goalkeeper saves a ball from going into the net, credit that team
   with a team save. The save is credited to the teamʼs total for the game but not to the individual
   goalkeeper.
6. If a field player must play a game as goalkeeper due to excessive team injuries, etc., that player
   shall not be credited with a game played regarding per-game averages for points, goals and assists.
   This applies only if the field player plays the entire game in goal and does not register a goal or
   assist.
   OVERTIME, TIEBREAKER PROCEDURE
1. All statistics that occur during overtime count toward team and individual totals. However, if the
   game reaches the point where a tiebreaker procedure of taking kicks from the penalty-kick line or spot
   occurs, no statistics — goals or saves — count toward team or individual totals.
   GAME-WINNING GOALS
   Article 1. A game-winning goal is credited to the player scoring the goal that is one more than the
   opposing teamʼs final total.
