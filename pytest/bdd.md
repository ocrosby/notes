# Pytest-BDD

Pytest-BDD is a plugin for pytest that lets users write tests as Gherkin feature files rather than test functions. 
This allows for test cases to be written in plain language and easily shared with non-programmers. Pytest-BDD is 
built on top of the `pytest` test framework and is compatible with `pytest` fixtures.

## Installation

```Shell
pip install pytest-bdd
```

## Usage

To run a test, you can use the `pytest` command:

```Shell
pytest test_sample.feature
```
