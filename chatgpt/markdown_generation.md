# How to Prompt ChatGPT for Easy-to-Copy Markdown Documents

## Introduction
When asking ChatGPT to generate markdown documents, it sometimes formats the response in a way that makes it difficult to copy and paste. This guide explains how to prompt ChatGPT to display the entire markdown document in a single, raw, plaintext cell.

## Effective Prompt
To ensure the markdown document is displayed in a single code block without formatting issues, use the following prompt:

```plaintext
Generate a full markdown document and display it in a single code block as raw markdown. Do not format it as a preview or split it into multiple sections.
```

Alternatively, if you want to ensure itâ€™s always contained in a single, scrollable block, you can ask:

```plaintext
Provide the entire markdown document inside a single code block with triple backticks (```), so I can easily copy and paste it.
```

This will ensure that ChatGPT presents the markdown content in a single raw code block, making it easy to copy and paste without formatting issues.
