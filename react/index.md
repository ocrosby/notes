# React

## Overview

This document contains my personal notes on React

The big deal about react is that it is Declarative instead of Imperative.  This means 
that you tell it what you want and it figures out how to do it.  This is in contrast 
to Imperative programming where you tell it how to do it.

### Creating a new local React project

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```
