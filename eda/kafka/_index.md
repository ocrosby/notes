# Apache Kafka

Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform. It is used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming apps. 
It is horizontally scalable, fault-tolerant, wicked fast, and runs in production in thousands of companies.

## The Basics

- `Messages` are organized into `topics`
- `Producers` push messages
- `Consumers` pull messages
- Kafka runs in a cluster. Nodes are called `brokers`
